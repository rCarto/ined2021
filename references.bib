abstract="This paper deals with the production of statistical mapsStatistical mapsas part of the wider reproducible research paradigm. The current and most widespread ways to produce statistical maps combine several software products in a complex toolchain that use a range of data and file formats. This software and diversity of formats makes it difficult to reproduce the same analysis and maps. The aim of this paper is to put forward a unified workflow that allows map production in a reproducible process. We suggest hereby the cartographypackageCartography package, an extension of the R softwareR software, that fills the need of specific thematic mapping solutions.",
